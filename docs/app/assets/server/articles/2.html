<p>Welcome to the Theoi Project, a site exploring Greek mythology and the gods in classical literature and art. The aim of the project is to provide a comprehensive, free reference guide to the gods (<em>theoi</em>), spirits (<em>daimones</em>), fabulous creatures (<em>theres</em>) and heroes of ancient Greek mythology and religion.</p>

<h2>THEOI GREEK MYTHOLOGY</h2>
<p>The Theoi Project profiles each deity and creature of Greek mythology on a separate page, incorporating an encyclopedia summary, quotations from a wide selection of ancient Greek and Roman texts, and illustrations from ancient art. Analysis of the texts and interpretation of the stories of myth is currently beyond the scope of the project. For such detailed analysis, I would suggest consulting some of the good books available on the subject.</p>
<p>Transliterated forms of Greek names are used throughout the biography pages of the site rather than their Latin forms, e.g. Kirke instead of Circe, Ouranos for Uranus, Apollon in place of Apollo, etc. The index and introduction pages, however, use the Latin name-forms for ease of reference.</p>
<p>The <a href="Library.html">Theoi Classical Texts Library</a> contains an extensive collection of classical literature on the theme of Greek mythology, including the works of many of the lesser known poets which are not available online elsewhere. Please note, that these are not the same texts which are quoted on the biography pages of Theoi.com, which are listed separately on the <a href="Bibliography.html">Bibliography</a> page.</p>
<p>Summaries of the most important of the Greek gods, as well as classes of divinity can be found on the <a href="Pantheon.html">Pantheon</a> and <a href="greek-mythology/greek-gods.html">Greek Gods</a> pages. The fabulous creatures, tribes and monsters of Greek mythology are listed in the <a href="greek-mythology/bestiary.html">Bestiary</a>.</p>
<p>The entire <a href="Tree.html">Family Tree</a> of the Greek pantheon of gods is displayed over eight charts with a central name index. There is also a separate table outlining the genealogy of the gods from <a href="TreeHesiod.html">Hesiod's <em>Theogony</em></a>. </p>
<p>A simple map of the various kingdoms of Greek mythology can by found on the <a href="greek-mythology/kingdoms.html">Kingdoms</a> page. Other themed pages include <a href="Flora1.html">Plants and Flowers</a> in Greek mythology and <a href="greek-mythology/star-myths.html">Star Myths</a>.</p>
<p>The site contains a <a href="Galleries.html">Gallery</a> of more than 1200 pictures from ancient Greek and Roman art, including vase paintings (C6th to C4th B.C.), sculptures, frescos and mosaics (C4th B.C. to C4th A.D.).</p>
<p>The Theoi.com pages can be searched using the Google box at the top left-hand corner of this page.</p>
